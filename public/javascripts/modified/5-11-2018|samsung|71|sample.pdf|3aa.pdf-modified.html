ltex and pdfltex capabilities

1.3.1 overview
a
first you edit your source .tex ﬁle. in ltex you compile it using the latex
command to a .dvi ﬁle (which stands for device-independent). the .dvi ﬁle
can be converted to any device-dependent format you like using an appropriate
driver, for example dvips.
when producing .pdf ﬁles you should use pdflatex, which produces directly .pdf ﬁles out of .tex sources. <span style ='color:red'><b>NOTE</b></span> that in the .tex ﬁle you may need
to use some pdf speciﬁc packages.
for viewing .tex ﬁles use your favourite text editor, for viewing .dvi ﬁles
under x window system use xdvi command, .ps ﬁles can be viewed with gv
(or ghostview) and .pdf ﬁles with acroread, gv or xpdf.
